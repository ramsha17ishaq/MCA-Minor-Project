      <p class="card-text" style="color: rgba(139, 0, 104, 0.809);">Neurology is the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of disorders of the nervous system. The nervous system is a complex, sophisticated system that regulates and coordinates body activities. It has two major divisions:

        Central nervous system: the brain and spinal cord
        Peripheral nervous system: all other neural elements, such as eyes, ears, skin, and other "sensory receptors"
        A doctor who specializes in neurology is called a neurologist. The neurologist treats disorders that affect the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, such as:
        
        Cerebrovascular disease, such as stroke
        Demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis
        Headache disorders
        Infections of the brain and peripheral nervous system
        Movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease
        Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease)
        Seizure disorders, such as epilepsy
        Spinal cord disorders
        Speech and language disorders
        Neurologists do not perform surgery. If one of their patients requires surgery, they refer them to a neurosurgeon.
